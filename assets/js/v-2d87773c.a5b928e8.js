When you start out, the human capital is high while wealth is low. Midway (around 40 years), there should be assets which show the result of past 15-20 years of use of the human capital. At 65-70 years of age, the human capital is almost spent and now the wealth capital has to take care of rest of the life.</p><p>Now it is important to understand how the human capital is being converted into wealth. If it is in the way of:</p><ul><li>A solid government job, without firing, then it should be considered as a solid bond with a decent coupon rate.</li><li>A big firm with good HR practices, then consider yourself to be a low-risk blue chip stock.</li><li>A freelancer with variable pay and/or performance linked pay, then consider yourself as a non-bluechip stock.</li></ul><p>Place yourself in the risk-return continuum according to above 3 examples.</p><p>How you should allocate your assets depends upon what you are. So if you are a bond, then you should have an increased allocation to the equities. While if you are the <em>freelancer group / non-bluechip stock</em>, it would be better to have more allocation to the bonds in your wealth portfolio. The more like a stock you are in your income flows and job security, the lesser should be your allocation to equity. This is asset allocation at a totally different level and makes the investing decision much simpler for an individual.</p>',6),i={render:function(e,o){return a}}}}]);
