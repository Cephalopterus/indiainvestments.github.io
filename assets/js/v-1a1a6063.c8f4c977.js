Senior citizens get a deduction of ₹50,000 under Section 80TTB and this includes interest earned from savings bank accounts as well as bank fixed deposits.</p><p>The second natural choice for most people should be <strong>bank fixed deposits</strong> which have reasonable liquidity and safety for parking money. As of January 2021, most big banks are offering anywhere between 4.9% to 5.5% interest rates on FDs. However, unlike bank accounts which are tax-exempt if the interest amount is less than ₹10,000, all interest income from a fixed deposit is taxable. The bank will auto deduct TDS @ 10% if your interest income from FDs exceed ₹40,000. You’ll have to pay any additional taxes later if you fall under income tax slabs higher than 10%.</p><p>You can also park your money in certain debt mutual funds. This includes <strong>overnight funds</strong> and <strong>liquid funds</strong> for parking money for a few months and <strong>money market funds</strong> for a few years. However, note that unlike savings account and fixed deposits, debt mutual funds are <em>marked to market</em> which means that you should expect some volatility in day to day NAV. This volatility is mostly negligible in overnight and liquid funds but we have seen events like the Covid 19 crash in March 2020 when even liquid funds experienced a few days of relatively high volatility.</p><p>Here are the NAV graphs of HDFC Liquid fund, the biggest liquid fund in India in terms of AUM, and Parag Parikh Liquid fund during the covid crisis.</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/T9OktS0.png" alt=""><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G6ey8hB.png" alt=""></p><p>That being said, investments in debt funds don’t incur TDS or taxes until you redeem money from them. Many liquid funds also offer instant redemption up to ₹50,000 at any time of the day although the reliability of the instant redemption depends on the AMC website.</p><p>As an example, ₹1 lakh kept for 1 year in IDFC First savings bank account at 6% interest would give you ₹6,000. If you keep it in a savings bank account in big banks like SBI, HDFC, and ICICI, you&#39;ll get anywhere from ₹2,700 to ₹3,500. This interest income would be tax-free (since it&#39;s less than ₹10,000). A bank fixed deposit might give you anywhere from ₹4,991 to ₹5,875 and you&#39;d have to pay taxes on it.
