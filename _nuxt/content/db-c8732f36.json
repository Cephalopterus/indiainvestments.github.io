Is it possible?\n- Whether one can consistently beat the market — and what it takes.\n\n# Beating the market — what it means\n\nThe phrase *beating the market* can mean different things for different people. The intuitive definition is to earn returns on a portfolio level that consistently beats the market index. However, more people allocate their equity investments in funds managed actively than passively - so it makes sense to see how your returns stack up against that of professional investors, or atleast try to understand how an individual investor has a fighting chance against  instituitions in the chase for every possible rupee gain. \n\n## Beating the index\n\nIt's easy to achieve average market performance, one simply needs to *buy the market* through a low cost index or exchange trading fund - and there's nothing wrong with aiming to get what is known as market returns; between February 2000 to 2020, over a 20 year period, Nifty Total Return Index had a compounded annualized growth rate of 14.3% per year, comfortably beating inflation. \n\nIf effecient market hypothesis is to be believed, stock prices reflect consensus view of all publicly available information that can have a material impact on the price action of the stock. However, that doesn't render the exercise of finding mismatches between price and intrinsic value of a stock ineffectual. Instead, it involves finding instances where the consensus view of the market is itself inaccurate, thus creating an opportunity to make money from the difference.\n\nSo, if an analytical mind is willing to invest time and effort in pursuit of such mismatches, earning profits higher than the market returns is possible, and can be a great tool to create wealth for goals.  \n\n## Beating professional investors\n\nThere are several logical, financial, and regulatory obstructions that a professional investor has to face, which makes the prospects of beating them higher. Some are, \n\n- The account size of professional investors is such that any meaningful investment in a midcap or smallcap stock has an impact on its price. And so, they're constrained with a limited universe of companies to pick from. \n- Professional investors are bound by the mandate of the fund they manage, and so any investment that falls outside of this mandate is out of the question, further constraining the universe of companies to invest in.\n- Like an individual investors, the performance of a professional investor is compared to market returns. However, unlike an individual investor, a professional investor can't pragmatically afford to underperform the market for a long duration at the risk of losing their clients. To a professional investor, this is known as *benchmark risk,* and the only way to keep up for them is to imitate an index once a reasonable alpha is generated. Once this happens, the professional investor generally tends to stop caring about additional returns, and rather focuses on averting losses that could cost them their jobs.\n- Most professional investors lean towards having a diversified portfolio as a consequence of avoiding these risks, and thus outperforming the market with such diversification is relatively improbable compared to a curated portfolio maintained by an individual investor.\n\n### Is beating the market the only goal in stock picking?\n\nIt is worth noting that the exercise of comparing an individual investor's returns against that of the market, and that of professional investors is relative in nature. However, picking stocks should encompass more than that. Critics would be correct to note that majority of individual investors beating the market luck out on taking incremental risks that they don't necessarily know or acknowledge. As Seth Klerman notes in his annotation in Howard Marks' *The Most Important Thing —*\n\n> \"Beating the market matters, but limiting risk matters just as much. Ultimately, investors have to ask themselves whether they are interested in relative or absolute returns. Losing 45 percent while the market drops 50 percent qualifies as market outperformance, but what a pyrrhic victory this would be for most of us.\"\n\nAn argument can be made that another upside to the exercise of stock picking is that if it is done correctly, the comprehension of risks associated with the equity you hold is higher than when investing in a fund — active or passive. The reason is simple: it takes less time and effort to keep track of stocks in the individual investor's concentrated portfolio than stocks in a diversified equity fund.\n\n# Can you beat the market?\n\nEstablishing the possibility of beating the market is kaput enables delusion if one doesn't acknowledge what it takes to do it consistenly — a brutal cocktail of time, effort, discipline, conviction, contrarianism, and an investment philosophy to invest the time, effort, discipline, and conviction in.\n\n## Sticking to an investment philosophy\n\nAn investment philosophy can be thought of as a construct of mental models upon which the investor builds his portfolio upon. If the universe of stocks under the investor's circle of competence is chaos - an unexplored territory of potential, the investor mines out order from this chaos in the form of a portfolio, using mental models as stencils. The lack of having an investment philosophy generally results in owning stocks that are not a perfect fit for the portfolio. As Chuck Palahniuk writes in his book,\n\n> 'If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.'\n\nSo, mental models help investors validate their strategy by providing a confined framework, and an investment phiolosphy is a set of mental models that the investor follows. Luckily, mental models in stock picking have been figured out to a large extent (such as momentum, growth, low multiples, and value investing), one simply needs to recognise, study, and implement them.\n\n## Second level thinking — having an *edge*\nFor all intents and purposes, every investor (professional and individual) competes in pursuit of profits in any asset working with the same information available in the public forum. The consensus on the impact of this information is what establishes the stock price in the short run, and so if your view aligns with that of the majority, it makes sense that you'll largely make market returns. Every investor can't beat the market as together they are the market. To get extraordinary returns, you need to have an extraordinary perspective. This is what Howard Marks calls *second level thinking*, Ben Graham calls *trace of wisdom*, and Warren Buffett & Charlie Munger calls *having an edge.*\n\nThis is not to say the consensus view of information is always wrong, in all likeliness millions of other investors may be smarter and more knowledgable than you. The idea is to find instances where the individual investor can use contrarian insight that the market isn't reflecting, and it has to be accurate, or atleast *more correct* than the consensus view. \n\nTo quote Howard Marks' *The Most Important Thing,*\n\n> Only if your behavior is unconventional is your performance likely to be unconventional, and only if your judgments are superior is your performance likely to be above average. For your performance to diverge from the norm, your expectations— and thus your portfolio—have to diverge from the norm, and you have to be more right than the consensus. Different and better: that’s a pretty good description of second-level thinking.\n\nMarks also proceeds to provide a framework, a set of questions that you must ask yourself when working with contrarian thinking,\n\n- What is the range of likely future outcomes?\n- Which outcome do I think will occur?\n- What’s the probability I’m right?\n- What does the consensus think?\n- How does my expectation differ from the consensus?\n- How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?\n- Is the consensus psychology that’s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?\n- What will happen to the asset’s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I’m right?\n\nTo sum it up, holding consensus view on any material information comes naturally to us — specially if an investor relies on financial news channels or social media to acquire information; but that's not how above average returns can be achieved, by definition consensus views largely yields market return. The ability to accurately spot mismatches between price and intrinsic value of an asset requires *an edge.* ","dir":"/en/faqs","path":"/en/faqs/can-you-beat-the-market","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","to":"/faqs/can-you-beat-the-market","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1612605374403},"$loki":5},{"slug":"dd-template","title":"Due Diligence (DD) checklist","category":"faqs","position":12,"toc":[{"id":"sectorindustry","depth":2,"text":"Sector/Industry"},{"id":"business","depth":2,"text":"Business"},{"id":"financials--ratios","depth":2,"text":"Financials & Ratios"},{"id":"management","depth":2,"text":"Management"},{"id":"valuation","depth":2,"text":"Valuation"},{"id":"investment-thesis","depth":2,"text":"Investment Thesis"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"sectorindustry"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#sectorindustry","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"Sector/Industry"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Product"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{"className":["contains-task-list"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{"className":["task-list-item"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"input","props":{"disabled":true,"type":"checkbox"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"  What is the sector primarily selling?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{"className":["task-list-item"]},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"input","props":{"disabled":true,"type":"checkbox"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"  How is the sector sub-classified based on product segments?

Over-simplified & shortened description of how it works: It collects premium from policyholders, then it invests that in market-linked securities (bonds, stocks, CP, CD, commodities etc.). Eventually, it pays out policyholders after keeping some cut for itself.\n\nUnlike bank or post-office deposits, LIC returns are not legally guaranteed. Govt. of India is a major stakeholder in LIC, but that does not mean it’s a major stakeholder in your future. Govt. would do its best to prevent LIC from going under. But your returns come at the cost of LIC’s income - when those two are at odds with each other, Govt. would pick LIC over you.\n\nIn practice, LIC returns money you’d paid as premium + some bonus. They have different categories of these bonuses: loyalty bonus, guaranteed addition. LIC wants to make you feel they’re doing you a favor by giving you some bonus. Historically, a bank FD at SBI would have had higher returns than LIC policy over same period.\n\nYou can know only know your bonus after the policy matures.\n\nLIC is also not allowed to invest freely. They are the largest financial services company in the country, and therefore has much more cash than any other financial institution, that they can invest. However, large corpus of few lakh crores are not easy to invest. So they have to look for distressed assets, or wait for really bad market condition before deploying some of that cash.\n\nThere’s also political interference to consider - as evident from LIC’s bailout of IDBI bank. LIC’s hands are tied in where they can and cannot invest.\n\nOver long enough period of time, LIC returns have also significantly underperformed equity market returns, namely Nifty & Sensex Total Return Index.\n\nNow, consider various charges on insurance (mortality charges, admin fees, risk premium etc.). These are not shown to you, the end policyholders; but these eat away your corpus and line up LIC’s pocket.\n\nYour agent would tell you to invest in LIC policy, because that helps him earn commission. Your parents would pressure you into doing it, because most likely they’d not be aware of other investment options.\n\nThe fact that it has tax benefits is of little concern, because gains from LIC policies are so low, taxing it won’t make much difference in final corpus size, post-tax.\n\nAt its core, an LIC policy is an insurance policy. The cover provided by this insurance is inadequate, to take care of your family’s financial needs in your absence. A pure term cover is better, which works very different from how a typical LIC policy works.\n\nBut none of the above covers real problem with an LIC policy - it locks you into a lifelong decision much early on. For a lot of people, who had subscribed to LIC policies 20-25 years ago, and seeing their policies maturing now - the maturity amount is probably not even worth a month’s income.\n\nDue to inflation, the maturity estimate which might look huge today, would be much lower in value, upon actual maturity.\n\nThese premiums cannot be changed once you start paying for a policy. You have no option of stepping up your premiums as your salary increases year on year.\n\nOverall, an LIC policy is rigid, wasteful, and doesn’t provide adequate coverage. Tax benefits are not good enough to offset the opportunity cost (i.e. you’re missing out on other efficient assets and time).\n\n## TL;DR\nAvoid LIC policies, buy vanilla pure term cover, and invest in efficient market-linked transparent assets yourself.

Start putting your money into your account / liquid fund over all those 10 years, and then invest lumpsum at the end of 10 years, OR\n    \n2. You should start putting the money directly into Equity as a regular SIP.\n\nThe answer is obviously 2, since you will not be missing out on all those 10 years of equity returns.\n\n## Should you split your single SIP into multiple SIPs?\n\nThis is just another form of 1. As we understand, Lumpsums tend to win more often than not as compared to SIP, it is better to put a single SIP at a comfortable time. By comfortable time, I mean that if you receive your salary on 5th, then set up your SIP date to 15th or so; this gives you flexibility when your salary will get delayed (it is almost inevitable that this will happen). The added advantage of a single SIP is that the paperwork of future capital gains tax calculations will be easier. Having weekly/daily SIPs will have hundreds of entries and calculations after a few years.\n\n## TL;DR \nif you have money to invest for a long term, put that money into a diversified equity asset ASAP. If you have got lumpsum (eg, bonus money or tax refund), then invest lumpsum. If you have regular stream, then invest at a regular interval.","dir":"/en/faqs","path":"/en/faqs/lumpsum-vs-sip","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","to":"/faqs/lumpsum-vs-sip","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1612605374564},"$loki":12},{"slug":"park-money","description":"Let's start with the absolute basic thing you can do. **Nothing**.

By keeping this in mind, one can change from the more stressful kind of jobs to more relaxed ones much before the actual retirement.\n\nThis way of thinking is slightly different from the usual Accumulation phase where you work, work and work and suddenly when you cannot or do not want to, you take an (arbitrary) age-based retirement and hope to live off whatever you have got.","dir":"/en/wiki","path":"/en/wiki/critical-mass","extension":".md","createdAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","updatedAt":"2021-02-06T09:55:04.941Z","to":"/wiki/critical-mass","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1612605374604},"$loki":15},{"slug":"us-investing","description":null,"title":"US Investing","category":"wiki","position":4,"toc":[{"id":"us-etfs-and-index-funds","depth":2,"text":"US ETFs and Index Funds"},{"id":"meeting-the-indices","depth":2,"text":"Meeting the Indices"},{"id":"dow-jones-industrial-average-djia","depth":3,"text":"Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)"},{"id":"sp-500-index","depth":3,"text":"S&P 500 Index"},{"id":"nasdaq-composite-index","depth":3,"text":"NASDAQ Composite Index"},{"id":"crsp-us-total-market-index","depth":3,"text":"CRSP US Total Market Index"},{"id":"the-major-funds-us-domiciled","depth":2,"text":"The Major Funds (US Domiciled)"},{"id":"spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy","depth":3,"text":"SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)"},{"id":"cheatsheet","depth":2,"text":"Cheatsheet"},{"id":"us-domiciled","depth":3,"text":"US Domiciled"},{"id":"ucits","depth":3,"text":"UCITS"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"us-etfs-and-index-funds"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"#us-etfs-and-index-funds","ariaHidden":"true","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"US ETFs and Index Funds"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are several indices involved in the US markets similar to the Indian counterparts Sensex and Nifty.
